# Introduction
The Build Your Hydroponic Garden kit project seeks to address the educational needs of K-5 students by providing a comprehensive STEAM educational kit. By engaging in this project, students will build a hydroponic garden and deepen their understanding of the crucial concept of photosynthesis, recycling, and how the electrical components within a garden system function (sensors, pumps, light, etc.). The kit is poised to be an innovative educational tool that fosters creativity and critical thinking and instills a lasting understanding of key scientific principles.


# Learning Objectives:

Demonstrate Integration of Electronics and Software:
* The student will showcase the integration of electronics hardware and software to create a functional system that accomplishes specific tasks.

Construct Knowledge through Sensor Exploration:
* Students will actively engage in exploring real-world issues using a variety of sensors, demonstrating their ability to curate, analyze, and evaluate information from digital resources.

Understand Plant Life Cycle:
* Students will create a suitable environment for plants to growth. They will see the stages of the plant cycle in real time as they take care of their garden.

Learning to Conserve Earthâ€™s Resources:
* Students will learn how to reduce waste by using recycled materials to build the garden system.

# Georgia Standards of Excellence:
* CSS.KC.3-5.2.2: Build knowledge by actively exploring real-world issues using a variety of resources and digital tools to construct knowledge and produce creative artifacts.
* CSS.KC.3-5.2.1: Curate (analyze and evaluate) information from digital resources using a variety of tools and methods to create collections of artifacts that demonstrate meaningful connections or conclusions.
* S2L1-LS1B: Plants and animals have unique and diverse life cycles including being born (sprouting in plants), growing, developing into adults, reproducing, and eventually dying.
* S3L2-ESS3.C: Individuals are doing things to help protect Earthâ€™s resources and environments.
